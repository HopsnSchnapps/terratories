# The Experience

Multiple things are involved in the production of Terratories.

Terratories NFT will deliver an experience combining blockchain with the outside world. You will select your bion, build cairns anywhere you choose to explore, raise up elems, and fight to terraform Earth in order to strengthen your Ancient. The Torch is coming..

## The Speakers NFT

Cairn Placement NFTs will be airdropped to Speaker holders and become available to procure. These are consumable NFTs used to geotag a location of the world you explore and become converted into a unique name and customized badge. Once a location is marked, no other Cairn can be placed within 333 feet. Want to claim Mount Everest? Get up there and plant one before anyone else

## Exploration



## Harvesting

Time to harvest mena from your cairns and visit other cairns to gather mena from theirs. A map will release showing all cairns in real time. Walk over to the location of a cairn to log that you've visited its location. Players will be given a digital passport where they can receive a badge stamp for each cairn visited. Visit a cairn more than once and you'll get tallies showing the most frequented.

## Markethouse

The marketplace is open! Time to spend your well earned mena on real world goods and further digital assets. Purchase more cairns, unlockable badge traits, promotional deals, merchandise, and most importantly - elems from your bion.

## Gameplay

Let the terraforming begin! Use your elems to begin taking over enemy cairns and fight for your bion. Strengthen your elem so they grow stronger and become the fighter you need. Build up defenses on your own cairns to keep the fight alive. Bions with the most land conquered at the end of the season are rewarded with digital rewards.
